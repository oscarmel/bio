Biography 

  Hello, my name is Oscar Mel Domingo, I am 19, and also a Year Up student here at Seattle Central 
and I am currently in their software development and testing track. Year Up is a program that helps young adults like I,
train for future careers. I am currently learning how to use excel, HTML, and I'm also happening to be studying
business communications, and many more valuable skills that will help me succeed in life.

  On my free time I like to make videos. It is currently one of my main sources of income.
I have been editing videos ever since I was 13 and a few months back I had just started directing and editing music videos 
for local artists. I always wanted to be in the music industry, but I never knew how. 
I figured that I love editing and I love music, so why not make music videos. I have experience editing on sony vegas, 
after effects, and premiere pro. I hope to one day to make this my full time job but as of right now my focus is on 
software development.

  One thing I really hope to get out of this program is a job I enjoy. I really want to work a job that I enjoy because 
I'd rather do something I love for low pay, than do something I hate for high pay. Conveniently enough for me tech jobs 
happen to pay pretty well. Something that is very important to me is financial
stability, because I believe that if I can be financialy stable while doing a job I enjoy, I am living life right. I can't 
wait to see how much my life changes in a year.
